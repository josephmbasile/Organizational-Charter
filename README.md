# Organizational-Charter
A charter for organizing a co-op.

This charter was developed several years ago with the intention of registering as an S-corporation and competing economically with corporations. Starting from version 2-6:

Burrillville Realization Group (henceforth “the Company”) is a business which operates democratically, and where all labor is performed by the Owners. It is a labor union which includes the strategic decision-making roles normally filled by an employer. It is owned by the people who do the work. 

The Mission of the Company is the advancement of well-being for all people. To accomplish this goal we will operate business ventures designed to generate revenue through which we can secure our own well-being and consequently become empowered to help others. Additionally, we will cooperate with like minded businesses.

 ## Founding Principles

All people deserve to live a life of well-being for as long as is feasible and to have agency to affect their own well-being. The Company intends to ensure that this is possible for all people regardless of their race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or ethnicity.

All conscious beings deserve to experience existence free from suffering. Although we cannot expect to guarantee this for all conscious beings, we must be mindful to always minimize suffering caused by our actions.

All cultures add to the richness of life and thus contribute directly to the well-being of all people. This is not to excuse the destructive elements of various cultures, which are best turned into history lessons.

The opinions of All Owners are valid and nobody can stop an Owner from voicing their opinion in civil discourse.

Our operations are subject to the rule of law.

The Earth and its Biosphere are essential to the well-being of all people and must therefore be protected from harm.

Conservation of resources is key to success and should be practiced by All Owners as a way of life.

## Incorporation

The organization will be incorporated as an S-scorporation in the state where the majority of the owners will reside.

Our common stock is called Equal Ownership Shares (EOSs) and they are so called because of the limit placed on their ownership: No person may own other than 1.0 EOS. If an owner comes to own more than 1.0 EOS, the excess will be paid out at the next close of business.

An EOS is an equity claim on the Net Assets of the company. The amount of the claim is the total Net Assets of the Company divided by the number of EOS outstanding. 

## Elections

The organization will elect a President who shall preside over the general conference and bring it to order. The President will be paid a bonus based on the payroll generated.

The organization will elect a CEO to enact a business plan. The CEO will be paid a bonus based on the surplus generated.

The organization will elect a board of directors to oversee health, safety, finance, and legal compliance. The board of directors will be paid a bonus based on the company's record.
